<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(01:51:26 PM)</font> <b>Dave Hughes:</b></font> I know it's more than likely fake but it's still funny<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(02:05:45 PM)</font> <b>Charlotte:</b></font> It just is fake<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(02:47:58 PM)</font> <b>Dave Hughes:</b></font> I know they're fake (usually say more than likely because anything is possible, even if extremely improbable)<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(02:48:05 PM)</font> <b>Dave Hughes:</b></font> I just find the mental image funny<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(02:48:21 PM)</font> <b>Dave Hughes:</b></font> I do wonder about people who share them thinking they definitely happened<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(02:50:22 PM)</font> <b>Dave Hughes:</b></font> Like the stories of little kids who display amazing grammar AND wit to older people who they really shouldn't be talking to like that anyway<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(02:50:31 PM)</font> <b>Charlotte:</b></font> Yeah<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(02:50:34 PM)</font> <b>Charlotte:</b></font> Well<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(02:50:50 PM)</font> <b>Charlotte:</b></font> Tbh I don't think kids should be obliged to respect their elders<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(02:51:05 PM)</font> <b>Charlotte:</b></font> I say this because my entire family is abusive tho<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(02:51:11 PM)</font> <b>Dave Hughes:</b></font> Not if its not earned<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(02:51:25 PM)</font> <b>Charlotte:</b></font> I talk to everyone exactly the same way<br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(02:52:06 PM)</font> <b>Dave Hughes:</b></font> Your family is abusive so to hell with them. I hate the idea of obliged respect. But the idea of kids being nice to people who are simply talking to them, or just strangers. People think a kid would be able to get away with saying this stuff and not getting a telling off from their mom<br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(03:09:24 PM)</font> <b>Charlotte:</b></font> oh yeah i get you<br/>
