## Introduction

i3-config-builder is a format for encoding context for i3 config templates.

A complete i3-config-builder data structure is a [JSON](http://www.json.org/) object, but may be expressed in formats that map to JSON such as [YAML](http://yaml.org/).

### Example

An i3-config-builder object for an i3 theme:

```YAML

colors:
  base03:           '#002b36'
  base02:           '#073642'

## i3-config-builder Objects

An *i3-config-builder object* is always a single object. The i3-config-builder object may optionally have any of the members described below at its root. Each of the keys for the i3-config-builder object and all their members must only consist of word characters, digits, and the underscore.

### The Meta Object

The *meta object* may be present at the root of the i3-config-builder object with the key `meta`. If present, its value must be an object which may contain any of the following keys:

* `description`

If `description` is present, it must be a string less than 140 characters long and should briefly describe the purpose of the object.

### The Colors Object

The *colors object* may be present at the root of the i3-config-builder object with the key `colors`. If present, its value must be a single object with keys that each represent a *color alias*. The value of a color alias must be a single string value that expresses a valid *hex color code* in the same format as HTML hex color codes.

Other members of the i3-config-builder object may be specified to use color aliases in place of, or in addition to, hex color codes. Any other member with such a specificiation must satisfy:

1. It must have exactly one member which must be specified to be exclusively either a string or an object with string values but not both.
2. The string value or any member value of object each must be either a color alias such that there is a key in the colors object equal to that value or a valid hex color code.

### The Window Colors Object

The *windows colors object* may be present at the root of the i3-config-builder object with the key `window_colors`. If present, its value must be an object which may contain any of the following keys:

* `focused`
* `focused_inactive`
* `unfocused`
* `urgent`

For each of these keys that are present, its value must be an object which may contain any of the following keys:

* `border`
* `background`
* `text`
* `indicator`

For each of these keys that are present, its value must be a single string which is either a color alias or a hex color code.

### The Bar Colors Object

The bar colors object may be present at the root of the i3-config-builder object with the key `bar_colors`. If present, its value must be an object which may contain any of the following keys:

* `separator`
* `background`
* `statusline`
* `focused_workspace`
* `active_workspace`
* `inactive_workspace`
* `urgent_workspace`

If the any of the keys `separator`, `background`, or `statusline`, are present, its value must be a single string which is either a color alias or a hex color code.

If any of the keys `focused_workspace`, `active_workspace`, `inactive_workspace`, or `urgent_workspace` are present, its value must be a single object which may contain any of the following keys:

* `border`
* `background`
* `text`

If any of these keys are present, its value must be a single string which is either a color alias or a hex color code.
