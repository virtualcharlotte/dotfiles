It's designed especially for people who make frequent changes to their colorscheme to get things just right.\n\n* Easy to try out new themes right after you install.\n* Themes are easy to read, modify, and share.\n* Modifies your theme in place - extra template files are not needed.\n\nFor an overview of the capabilities of i3-style, see my [blog post](http://dubstepdish.com/blog/2013/11/06/introducing-i3-style/).\n\n## Installing\n\nTo install with [npm](https://npmjs.org/):\n\n    npm install -g i3-style\n\nThe `i3-style` executable should now be in your PATH.\n\n## Usage\n\nJust call `i3-style` with the name of the theme you want to try and where you want to write the config file to. i3-style will look for your config in the default place and apply the theme.\n\n    i3-style solarized -o ~/.i3/config --reload\n\nCheck the `themes` directory for the list of built-in themes.\n\nIf you want to modify a theme, copy it from `themes` and give it a `.yaml` extension. The object format is [well-documented](https://github.com/acrisci/i3-style/blob/master/doc/spec.md) and includes support for color aliases. Then back up your config and call i3-style.\n\n    i3-style ~/.i3/solarized.yaml -o ~/.i3/config\n\nJust keep doing that until you get it perfect (which might be never).\n\n## Send us themes!\n\nDo you have a cool colorscheme in your config file that you want to share with other people? i3-style can automatically convert it to a theme file:\n\n    i3-style --to-theme ~/.i3/config -o my-theme.yaml\n\nIf you have a new theme, or made an improvement to an existing theme, please make a pull request adding your theme to the `themes` directory!\n\n## License\n\nThis work is available under a FreeBSD License (see LICENSE).\n\nCopyright Â© 2013, Tony Crisci\n\nAll rights reserved.\n",
